Calpose is a lightweight, easy-to-use Calendar renderer/widget for Android/Jetpack Compose.

```diff
! NOTE: Given the Alpha-state of compose, it's important that the Compose-version of Calpose matches yours. 
! Preferably, the latest version would always be used in both cases. 
! Please consult the Version changelog below for more info.
```
## Renderer? 
The goal of Calpose is to avoid imposing rules or limitations in regards to the styling of the calendar. We want you to have full control
over the UI aspects using Composable widgets while Calpose deals with the Calendar intrinsics. In other words, Calpose will act as a 
renderer for your widgets based on the Calendar.

## Installation
Add Jitpack to your project build.gradle
```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        
        // When using build.gradle
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' } 
        
        // When using build.gradle.kts
        maven {
            setUrl("https://jitpack.io")
        }
    }
}
```

Add the dependency to your module, see top for `${CURRENT_VERSION}`
```groovy
dependencies {
    // build.gradle
    implementation 'com.github.sigmadeltasoftware:CalPose:${CURRENT_VERSION}'

    // build.gradle.kts
    implementation("com.github.sigmadeltasoftware:CalPose:${CURRENT_VERSION}")
}
```
## Usage

Using the Calpose Calender is pretty much as straightforward as using any Composeable widget:
 
```kotlin
@Composable
fun Calpose(
    month: YearMonth,
    actions: CalposeActions,
    widgets: CalposeWidgets,
    properties: CalposeProperties = CalposeProperties()
)
```

There are 3 main components which have to be passed: 

#### 1. YearMonth
Using a `YearMonth`, Calpose is able to determine the calendar structure and render accordingly. By manipulating this value (passing a different `YearMonth`), you can choose which
month should currently be displayed.

#### 2. Actions
`CalposeActions` is a data class of actions which can be called upon by Calpose. Please consult the dokka documentation of `CalposeActions` (or our examples below) to get a better idea of which actions are 
beneficial to your application: [CalposeActions.kt](https://github.com/sigmadeltasoftware/CalPose/blob/master/calpose/src/main/java/be/sigmadelta/calpose/model/CalposeActions.kt "CalposeActions.kt")  

#### 3. Widgets
`CalposeWidgets` is the most important component of Calpose, which will contain the definition of the composable widgets that will be rendered by Calpose. This is where you'll mainly define what your calendar
should look like. Consult the dokka documentation of [CalposeWidgets](https://github.com/sigmadeltasoftware/CalPose/blob/master/calpose/src/main/java/be/sigmadelta/calpose/model/CalposeWidgets.kt "CalposeWidgets.kt") 
to get a better idea of which widgets you can pass, and feel free to take a look at the examples below to get a better idea of how these can be used for scenario's where you want to have `clickable` days, etc...

#### Properties
There is also an optional component of `properties` which contains some properties for really fine-tuning your experience:
